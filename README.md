## 📜 License: GNU GPL v2

### 🤝 Our Philosophy:
- **Take it** - It's free, use it anywhere
- **Change it** - Modify, adapt, improve
- **Share it** - Distribute to friends, colleagues, enemies
- **Respect it** - Keep our names in the code, that's all we ask
- **Support it** - Donate if it saves you time/money (optional but appreciated)

### ❤️ What GPL v2 means for you:
✅ **Free forever** - No hidden costs, ever  
✅ **Open source** - See every line of code  
✅ **Modifiable** - Hack it, tweak it, make it yours  
✅ **Distributable** - Share with the world  

### 🚫 What GPL v2 prevents:
❌ Removing author credits (be cool, give credit)  
❌ Selling as proprietary software (open your changes if you sell)  
❌ Claiming you wrote it (we worked hard, acknowledge it)
